# Semantic Image and Text Alignment: Automated Storyboard Synthesis for Digital Advertising

## Business Objective

Recent advancements in machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, alongside the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), have enabled the intricate processing and interpretation of data, facilitating the creation of detailed, dynamic content that bridges the gap between textual concepts and visual storytelling. The business objective of this challenge is to harness these capabilities to transform textual descriptions of advertisement concepts and assets into detailed storyboards, visually depicting the narrative flow and user interaction within advertisements, thereby making the conceptualization of digital campaigns both more intuitive and impactful. Adludio, a leader in online mobile advertising, specializes in creating interactive ads that resonate with viewers through dynamic content. They are now embarking on an initiative to automate the end-to-end process of advertising production, aiming to streamline and enhance the ad creation process using advanced technologies.
